	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	<br>
	And sorry I could not travel both
	<br>
	And be one traveller, long I stood
	<br>
	And looked down one as far  as I could
	<br>
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
	<br>
	<br>
	Then look the other, as just as fair,
	<br>
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	<br>
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	<br>
	Though as for that the passing there
	<br>
	Had worn them really about the same,
	<br>


	<p>
		And both that morning equally lay
		<hr>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.

	'The Starlight Night' was
		one of two poems which Hopkins
		sent to his mother as a birthday present,

	the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'.
			What a birthday present!
